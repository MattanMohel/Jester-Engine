# Jester-Engine
A game engine (hypothetically) made using C++

Welcome to Jester Engine! The engine that will only probably ever become an actual engine!

A few things to help you set up if you for some reason want to use this:

1) Project requires, as far as I know, a Windows 10 computer
2) Uses C/C++ 17 standart and visual studio 
3) renderer using OpenGL is in the works, so far all I've got on that end are two trinagles that can simulate the all the colors of the rainbow... impressive, I know
4) If you played around with the engine, you might have realized that the updates are called fairly slowly, this is not because of preformance, but because FIXED update is called once every ~.2 seconds. If you want to test the top speed, change the "OnFixedUpdate" of Sample.h to "OnUpdate"
5) I don't have any real experience with building large-scale projects such as this, and although this may very well be out of my scope, any feedback would be appreciated

5) to interact with the game engine, go to the entrypoint.cpp file, there are a few examples there of how the systems set in place work
